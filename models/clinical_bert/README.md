In order to use clinical BERT, please clone the repository from https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/clinicalBERT and then set the parameter `path_to_clinical_bert_repo` in the parameters.py file to the path to this repo.  You will also need to download the pretrained model (as specified in the readme of the repo) and set `pretrained_model` in the parameters.py file to the path to that model directory.
